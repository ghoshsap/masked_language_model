- Character-level or k-mer tokenization (overlapping) with special tokens.
- BERT-style masking (80/10/10) with configurable probabilities.
- Efficient streaming FASTA/txt loader; handles long genomes by chunking.
- Mixed precision (AMP), gradient accumulation, cosine schedule with warmup.
- Checkpointing & resume support; small Transformer encoder baseline.
